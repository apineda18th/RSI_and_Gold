# Relative Strength Index and Gold: Can the RSI Strategy make you money?

Short answer is no, but the analysis is still quite interesting. 

### Buy-and-Hold vs. RSI

In this brief experiment, I looked to see how RSI would perform against a Buy-and-hold strategy. Buy-and-hold is intuitive. It involves buying a stock and holding it until a specified period. RSI involves a more complicated but simple strategy. Every $n$ days, we observe a stock and choose to buy or sell whether our stock is "oversold" or "overbought". 

Mathematical Form:

# $RSI = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + RS}$

where...

# $RS = \frac{\text{Average of x days' up closes}}{\text{Average of x days down closes}}$

To be honest, there is no specified $n$, you can tailor it to your thinking. In this experiment, I went with 14 because the majority of analysts online claimed that 14 was the "best" $n$. Based on the formula, we choose to buy or sell depending on RSI. Whenever the RSI is less than 30, we will buy the stock. Whenever, the stock is greater than 70, we will buy the stock. The graph below illustrates the RSI of gold over time.

The results are very VERY underwheling for RSI. The RSI strategy severely underperformed against a buy-and-hold. We ended up with $206 from investing $100. Pretty good? That's until you realize that if you invested $100 into gold and just held until 2025, you would've ended up with upwards of $700. So what happened? To understand why your need to understand RSI's flaws.


### The truth about RSI:

RSI gets a lot of online attention because of how simple and intuitive it is. However, its simplicity is its downfall. RSI treats stocks on too short of a window. RSI treats stocks on a basis of being undervalued or overvalued. However, there are external factors that contribute to a stock's updward performance. Stock performance is not limited to its past price. Stocks are dependent and tied to numerous other variables. Treating stocks on a small window and based off its previous price means that people who use RSI miss out on stock rallies, internal firm growth, and positive news. By the time, people from RSI return to the stock, they generally missed out on compounding returns. Furthermore, RSI implicitly assumes that stocks have mean-reverting properties. Stocks that exhibit mean-reverting properties are difficult to find and difficult to determine if these patterns will continue. Mean reversion is a financial theory that suggests asset prices will eventually return to their long-term mean or average. This concept is grounded in the belief that asset prices and historical returns will gravitate toward a long-term average over time. The greater the deviation from this mean, the higher the probability that the asset's price will move closer to it in the future. While this remains a contested topic, trading on a basis of buying and selling based on valuation tends to underperform against stocks that exhibit long-term trend patterns. Going out of your way to find stocks that have mean-reversion is a little backwards as these stocks typically underperform on an aggregate than a simplistic buy-and-hold strategy using blue chip stocks.

### The inconvenient truth:

The one thing that should always be talked about when discussing short-term trading stratgies is how expensive they are. Constant rebalancing will result in fees and charges that could dillute the investors' given returns on a stock. Additionally, assuming that an investor makes an income greater than the standard deduction, the RSI strategy gains will result in short-term capital gains. 

### In conclusion:

The RSI strategy has made people money. There is truth that you can make money using RSI. However, *will* you make money using RSI? Most likely, no or at the very least, you will underperform against a buy-and-hold. RSI is a flawed strategy that should not be the sole decision of a person's investment decision. RSI overlooks external factors, misses out on compounding returns, and accumulating fees in the long-run. RSI should be used with caution and awareness if it is being made for an investment decisions. Investors using RSI as a strategy should be aware of the downsides that come with the strategy and accept the outcome regardless.
